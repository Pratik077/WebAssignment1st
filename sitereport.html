            more knowledge to use css code and more over to make website resposive without having two double website
            for mobile and desktop. This module helps to make the resposive website using images and links. It gives 
            way to make the website user friendly as well. I uses the fonts and colour provided by css and focus on color
            which makes the website simple and more freindly. I used hover effect to make the website attractive so that 
            the user will never feel bore. The focus for developing this website is to get knowledge of html and css, 
            to make website resposive and user frienldy.
